more: "The bag's fabric is embedded with eXomesh Slashguard, a lightweight flexible, stainless steel wire mesh that protects your gear from a quick slash-and-run theft. The ToughZip double-layered zippers help prevent opportunistic thieves from breaking into the bag with a sharp object, and the interlocking zippers secure to the Roobar locking system, a central lockdown point that secures both pockets with a single padlock. For extra security, the 3mm stainless steel locking cable can be locked to the Roobar and around a secure fixture.

The padded adjustable shoulder straps come with a sternum strap and waist belt the help distribute your gear weight. The book style opening of the main compartment makes it easy to see everything inside, while the front zippered pocket has plenty of room for organization, including enough room for a 15-inch laptop.

Pacsafe keeps travelers one step ahead of the game by keeping their gear secure from opportunistic thieves with a wide range of stylish adventure backpacks, leisure bags, urban bags, women’s bags, and camera bags, as well as luggage and travel accessories."
